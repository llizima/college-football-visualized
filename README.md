# College Football Data Visualization Project

**Author:** Louis  
**Course:** Data Visualization â€” New College of Florida  
**Instructor:** Dr. Klingenberg  
**Midterm Project**

## Project Overview

This project explores trends and patterns in college football data using a variety of charts and visual techniques. The visualizations aim to uncover insights related to team performance, scoring behavior, and relationships between variables like points scored, opponents, and conference affiliation.

The dataset used is rich in categorical and quantitative variables, making it suitable for a wide range of chart types, from basic distributions to more advanced multi-dimensional representations.

## Contents

The project includes:

- A chart showing the distribution of a single categorical variable  
- A chart showing the distribution of a single quantitative variable  
- A chart showing the joint distribution of two categorical variables  
- A chart showing how a quantitative variable varies across categories of a categorical variable  
- A chart showing the relationship between two quantitative variables  
- One or more multi-variable visualizations using faceting or color to include a third/fourth variable  
- At least one advanced or novel chart type not discussed directly in class (e.g., radar chart, heatmap, contour plot, or sunburst chart)

Each chart is accompanied by a short paragraph explaining what the visualization reveals about the data.

## Dataset

The data comes from [CollegeFootballData.com](https://collegefootballdata.com/), a public API and platform offering detailed college football statistics including team records, game scores, player stats, and more.

## Tools & Technologies

- **R**
- **ggplot2**
- **dplyr**
- **tidyr**
- **readr**
- **plotly**, **ggiraph**, or other libraries for advanced visualizations

## Deliverables

- ðŸ“ˆ Final 4-page report (PDF or R Markdown output)
- Two-minute screencast presenting findings and visuals
- Four-minute class presentation + slides

## Collaboration

This repository is created for academic purposes. Dr. Klingenberg (bklingenberg@ncf.edu) has been added as a collaborator to monitor project progress.
